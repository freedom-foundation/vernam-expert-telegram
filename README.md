# vernam-expert-telegram
<h1>gist</h1>
https://github.com/freedom-foundation/vernam-expert-telegram is a repository I made and starred along with the important documents. I stared this because communicatuon is important - because docs have not much use if they cannot be sent and read.  There are all sorts of instant messengers chats, and emails and so forth online but none of them are secure. There is even a service called telegram. The vernam cipher historicly has a couple of names because it was invented by multuple people though I chose vernam because this inventor as I read used it to become an American telegram service business used in something important which was banking. I draw upon something that was already did before because it obviously can work. Now the vernam cipher has been called the perfect cipher because it is unbreakable: AS LONG AS YOU DO IT RIGHT. So you have to become an expert, the user has to know what he's doing. To do what? Send a telegram. Then this is the vernam expert telegram.
